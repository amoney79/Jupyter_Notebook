## Objective
- Load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python.
- Create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

**Dataset Used:** Iris dataset (from sklearn)

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Load the Iris dataset
- Display first few rows
- Check structure and missing values
- Clean dataset if needed

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Compute basic statistics
- Group by species and compute mean petal length


## Task 3: Data Visualization
Create four plots:
1. Line chart (Sepal length trend)
2. Bar chart (Average petal length per species)
3. Histogram (Sepal width distribution)
4. Scatter plot (Sepal length vs Petal length)


## Findings / Observations
- Iris setosa has the smallest average petal length.
- Iris virginica has the largest average petal length.
- Sepal width distribution is fairly normal but slightly skewed.
- Scatter plot shows clear species separation based on sepal and petal length.
